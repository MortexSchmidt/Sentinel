Place non-copyrighted short sound files here as click.mp3 and success.mp3. Example sources:
- https://freesound.org (use CC0 or appropriate license)
- https://mixkit.co (free sounds)

Files expected:
- click.mp3  (short UI tap)
- success.mp3 (short success chime)

I didn't include audio files for licensing reasons. Add them to public/sounds/ and the webapp will use them.
